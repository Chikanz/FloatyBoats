# Floaty Boat
Floaty boat is a unity game made for GGJ17 and polished after the jam finished. 

It's a kind of chill, top down game where you and a friend use the same controller to control two forest spirits. Create waves by throwing rocks into the river to guide your paper boat and avoid debris along the way.

The game has been open-sourced to allow others to use assets and learn <sup>~~also my github student plan ran out~~</sup>

It was made by these fine lads:
